          "longComment": "It's probably not the best sign that Morris is even hinting at the possibility of a long-term absence, although he did say Mooney is being evaluated on \"a week-to-week basis.\" The wideout left practice early July 24 after trying to make a diving catch, with subsequent reports suggesting he'd miss multiple weeks and was uncertain for Week 1 against Tampa Bay. If nothing else, this latest update confirms that the Falcons aren't sure about Mooney's availability for the start of the regular season. Wideout depth was already a weak point for the team, with No. 3 receiver Ray-Ray McCloud coming off a 2024 campaign in which he was one of the least productive starters in the league on a per-route basis (1.29 yards per route, with one TD on 87 targets). The Falcons didn't draft any wide receivers this spring, nor did they sign any likely starters in free agency, instead settling for the likes of UDFA Nick Nash and journeymen DJ Chark to round out the depth chart.",
          "shortComment": "Falcons coach Raheem Morris said Tuesday that he doesn't know when Mooney (shoulder) will return, but he's confident it will be this year, Josh Kendall of The Athletic reports.",

With Gesicki said to be nearing a return, there's not much room for the other tight ends to see enough targets for fantasy relevance. Fant and Hudson offer more pass-catching potential than Sample, in any case, considering the seventh-year Bengal has 100 catches and just four TDs in 78 regular-season games. It sounds like Sample's injury isn't considered serious, potentially allowing him to fill his usual block-first role come Week 1 at Cleveland.",

Meanwhile, Romeo Doubs (back) has returned to practice and is working in team drills with Malik Willis, who will continue to handle first-team reps until Love is fully cleared. All indications from Green Bay are that Love is fully on track for Week 1 against Detroit on Sunday, Sept. 7, but it wouldn't be surprising for LaFleur to hold the starting quarterback out of Saturday's preseason finale against the Seahawks, even if it's possible he could suit up were it a regular-season affair. With Week 1 the clear priority, expect the Packers to take a cautious approach as Love ramps up his activity level.",

The 2024 third-rounder has been hampered by hamstring injuries since entering the league, and that continues to be an issue for him as he enters his sophomore campaign. An exact timeline for Lloyd's return hasn't been established, but he is in jeopardy of missing the Packers' Week 1 contest against the Lions on Sunday, Sept. 7. Emanuel Wilson appears to be the clear-cut RB2 behind Josh Jacobs due to Lloyd's injury.",

Of course, Stafford being a full participant in practice doesn't necessarily indicate that Los Angeles has held full-contact sessions or that he has been completely cleared to participate in such activities, but Cameron DaSilva of USA Today reports that stacking days is exactly what the Rams hoped the veteran signal-caller would accomplish this week, and that he appears on track to play Week 1 barring any setbacks. As expected though, McVay confirmed that Stafford won't travel with the team to Saturday's preseason finale against the Browns, per Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.",

Jefferson, at least, returned to practice Monday and has begun ramping up his activity level with the goal of being fully healthy for Week 1 against the Bears on Monday, Sept. 8. Addison, for his part, will miss time early in the regular season due to his three-game suspension, though he'll be allowed to suit up for Friday's preseason finale against the Titans if coach Kevin O'Connell decides to play his starters.",

In that scenario, Aiyuk would figure to begin the season on the reserve/PUP list, then begin ramping his activity level up before hopefully taking the field Sunday, Oct. 12 on the road against Tampa Bay. Even then, it's conceivable Aiyuk could get off to a slow start and ramp his way up to a full starting share of snaps, meaning it would incentivize fantasy managers to plan ahead and roster alternative options at WR. With Jauan Jennings (calf) and Jacob Cowing (hamstring) still not practicing, and Jordan Watkins (ankle) out about a month, Ricky Pearsall and Demarcus Robinson currently are operating as the 49ers' clear top two wide receivers.",

          "longComment": "Godwin is expected to be ready to practice in some capacity beginning Week 2, and Tampa Bay evidently sees merit in allowing the veteran wideout to begin ramping up as soon as he's able. An October return date would still mean Godwin misses at least the first four games of the regular season, just as if he were to begin the year on IR, with the difference being that he'll be eligible to practice in the interim if carried on the 53-man roster. The Buccaneers' plan is good news with regard to Godwin's chances of hitting the ground running, but it could cause a headache for fantasy managers in seasonal formats, as it means Godwin will have to occupy one of limited roster spots rather than be designated for one of the IR slots common to most fantasy leagues. With Jalen McMillan (neck) also expected to miss time early in the season, Mike Evans, rookie first-round pick Emeka Egbuka and tight end Cade Otton figure to kick off 2025 with increased target volume.",
